# Apex Finance
this was my project for college where we have to create a website for our group project and its solely done by me, this i a dynamic website where you can see alot of things going on but most intresting place is its contact place where i have used firebase database to store data when a user tries to contact us.
I have deployed front end on Vercel which is best in my opinion for this type of temporary projects and for backend to save data i have used google's firebase database.
